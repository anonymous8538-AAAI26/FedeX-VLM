# AAAI26-FedeX-VLM

Fedex-VLM is a novel FL framework tailored for VLMs that addresses heterogeneity by leveraging client-specific knowledge levels.
Specifically, we enhance the weighting mechanism for VLMs in FL by applying a weighted smoothing to client weights and balancing client's contributions, while amplifying the influence of clients with model qualities, which possess a broader answer space in VLMs and exhibit better training progress and convergence.
Furthermore, we incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve interpretability on complex multi-modal data and decentralized FL settings, fostering better understanding and trust in the decision-making process.

This is an implementation for 'FedeX-VLM: Towards Knowledge Harmonization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Explainable Vision-Language Models' (under review).
